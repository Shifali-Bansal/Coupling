Coupling in Java (and in software engineering in general) refers to the degree of interdependence between software modules. It measures how closely connected different classes or modules are. Low coupling is generally desirable because it enhances maintainability, readability, and reusability of code.
Coupling refers to the knowledge or information or dependency of another class. It arises when classes are aware of each other. If a class has the details information of another class, there is strong coupling. In Java, we use private, protected, and public modifiers to display the visibility level of a class, method, and field. You can use interfaces for the weaker coupling because there is no concrete implementation.

### Types of Coupling

1. **Tight Coupling**:
   - Occurs when a class relies heavily on the specifics of another class. Changes in one class may require changes in the other.
   - **Example**:
   
     class Engine {
         void start() {
             System.out.println("Engine started");
         }
     }

     class Car {
         Engine engine = new Engine(); // Tight coupling

         void startCar() {
             engine.start();
         }
     }
    

   In this example, the `Car` class is tightly coupled with the `Engine` class. If you decide to change how `Engine` works (e.g., changing its name), you will have to modify the `Car` class as well.

2. **Loose Coupling**:
   - Occurs when classes are independent or only minimally dependent on one another. This is often achieved using interfaces or abstract classes.
   - **Example**:
    
     interface Engine {
         void start();
     }

     class GasEngine implements Engine {
         public void start() {
             System.out.println("Gas engine started");
         }
     }

     class ElectricEngine implements Engine {
         public void start() {
             System.out.println("Electric engine started");
         }
     }

     class Car {
         Engine engine; // Loose coupling

         Car(Engine engine) {
             this.engine = engine; // Dependency injection
         }

         void startCar() {
             engine.start();
         }
     }

     public class Main {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             Engine gasEngine = new GasEngine();
             Car car = new Car(gasEngine); // Car is not tightly coupled to a specific engine type
             car.startCar(); // Outputs: Gas engine started

             Engine electricEngine = new ElectricEngine();
             car = new Car(electricEngine);
             car.startCar(); // Outputs: Electric engine started
         }
     }
    

### Explanation

- **Tight Coupling**:
  - In the tight coupling example, the `Car` class is directly creating an instance of `Engine`. This makes it hard to change the `Engine` implementation without modifying the `Car` class.
  - **Downside**: If you want to use a different type of engine, you have to change the `Car` class. This leads to a lack of flexibility and increases maintenance overhead.

- **Loose Coupling**:
  - In the loose coupling example, `Car` depends on the `Engine` interface instead of a concrete class. It receives an `Engine` implementation via its constructor (dependency injection).
  - **Upside**: You can easily switch between different engine types without changing the `Car` class. This makes the system more flexible and easier to maintain.

### Benefits of Loose Coupling
- **Flexibility**: You can easily replace or modify components without affecting others.
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused in different contexts.
- **Maintainability**: Changes in one module are less likely to require changes in others.

In summary, coupling is a critical concept in software design that influences how easily software can be maintained and extended. Striving for loose coupling is generally considered best practice in designing systems.
